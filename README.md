# Heater_Control_System
This project is a smart heater system that watches the room temperature and controls a heater automatically. It has five states: Idle, Heating, Stabilizing, target Reached, and Overheat. A temperature sensor keeps checking the temperature. If it's too cold, the heater turns ON; if it's warm enough, it turns OFF. The system shows the current state using a buzzer or LED, sends updates through Bluetooth (BLE), and prints temperature and heater status on the Serial Monitor. It uses FreeRTOS or timer interrupts to check the temperature and update the system regularly, without missing anything.
